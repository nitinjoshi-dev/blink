### Prompt 1
datetime: 2025-10-22 16:22:12

I want to build a chrome plugin. This plugin will have following features:
1. A way for me to add a new link to shortcut. Assign a alias for this shortcut
2. If I type o/alias, it should redirect me to the link associated with the alias
3. There should also be a simple option where if in my current browser if I click on plugin, it can give me a quick option to add the website to my saved map with an alias. 
4. I can also add tags to the shortcut and also search for shortcuts by tags.
5. I should be able to group shortcuts by folders if needed. Anby search can be within the folder. Say a folder name work with link alias as meet can be searched as o/work/meet or work/meet or meet any shortcut that matches should be shown. 
6. I should also have a search dashboard where I can search for the alias and get the link associated with it. The search should be accessible via some keyboard shortcut. It should also have a simple UI where I can 10 frequenctly used shortcuts and I can type and search for any shortxcut needed, even one which are not favorite. I can press arrows keys and enter to select 1 from the list while searching as well. Search should also be possible via link text as well. Example if link is https://work.com/meet. If i search work it should show me all the shortcut wth work or within work folder or link containing work or shortcuts with tags as work. 
7. Easy option for me to export my shortcuts to a file and import them back.

Based on these expand on the features and write proper requirement and user stories in docs/requirement/ folder. Each feature can be a requirement or you can club few features together as 1 requirement. Add details to the requirement and expand the features.

#### Response
I created comprehensive requirements documentation in `docs/requirements/` folder with 5 detailed requirement documents.

**Files created:**
- `00-overview.md` - Project vision, core concept, key features summary, user flows, tech stack, and success metrics
- `01-core-shortcut-management.md` - CRUD operations, folder organization, undo support, data validation
- `02-search-navigation.md` - Search dashboard, omnibox integration, keyboard navigation, multi-criteria search
- `03-tags-and-categorization.md` - Tag management, tag-based search, tag visualization, bulk operations
- `04-import-export.md` - Export formats (JSON/CSV/HTML), import conflict resolution, auto-backup
- `05-settings-and-customization.md` - Customizable keyboard shortcuts, themes, privacy controls, data management

Each document includes 15-25 detailed user stories with acceptance criteria and technical implementation notes.

Answers
1. It is address bar integration. Was thinking for a way to do this. But not completely sure how to achieve this. Do you have any suggestions?
2. Locally for now as I don't have any domain to make this work
3. No preference either you can use vanilla js or react whatever you feel is write. For DB IndexDB or chrome storage both would work, just pick the 1 that you think can provide option to search and backup and restore.
4. Cmd + Shift + O seems good. But we can have user configure this to something else if needed. 
5. Exact alias match > part of the alias match > tag match > url matching
6. just 1 level is ok
7. No conflicts are allowed. If a alias already exist, it can't be added again. We cna edit it for sure, but can't add it. complete alias is foldername/alias. So if there are two links for meeting one can be inside folder work with alias as work/meet and other can be just /meet. Folder name is prefixed to the alias by default. Tags are not case sensistive. Only small cases tags are allowed. 

Feedback on suggestion:

1. Make sense. Let's do this. 
2. Perfect, want exactly this. 
3. Ok
4. Yes
5. Rather than showing url on hover, i would suggest a mouse free approach.i.e. show url along side the alias in the panel. I want to access entire of this without the need for mouse.
6. YES
7. YES

#### Response
Provided clarifications on technical approach for address bar integration and confirmed all design decisions:

**Address Bar Integration:** Suggested using Chrome's Omnibox API with "o" keyword for address bar suggestions. This is native to Chrome and requires no external setup.

**Tech Stack Decisions:**
- Storage: IndexedDB for flexible querying + chrome.storage.local for settings
- Frontend: React for UI components (with flexibility for vanilla JS)
- Database: IndexedDB provides better search capabilities and enables advanced queries

**Search Priority:** Confirmed exact alias > partial alias > tag > URL

**Unique Constraints:** Full alias (folder/alias) must be unique. Two aliases like "work/meet" and "meet" can both exist.

**Tags:** Lowercase only, case-insensitive matching

**Mouse-Free UX:** All interactions keyboard-navigable, URL shown alongside alias in results panel

Updated all 5 requirement documents with these confirmations and expanded features accordingly. Each requirement now includes:
- Comprehensive user stories with acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation guidance
- Data validation rules
- Performance considerations
- Assumptions
