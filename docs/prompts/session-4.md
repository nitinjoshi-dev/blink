In the Cmd + Shift + O popup, up and down arrow selection is not working. Also in dashboard search and search popup search search via folder like work/ is not working.

#### Response
I'll help you fix the arrow key navigation in the Cmd + Shift + O popup and the folder search functionality. Let me first examine the current codebase to understand the structure and identify the issues.

I've identified and fixed both issues:

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Arrow Key Navigation in Cmd + Shift + O Popup
**Problem**: The arrow keys weren't working properly in the SearchPopup component due to focus and event handling issues.

**Solution**: 
- Added a global keyboard event listener to ensure arrow key navigation works even when the popup is focused
- Enhanced the event handling to properly capture arrow key events
- Fixed the focus management to ensure the popup responds to keyboard input

### 2. Folder Search Functionality (work/ syntax)
**Problem**: The search functionality didn't properly handle folder-specific searches like `work/` or `work/meet`.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the `useDebouncedSearch` hook to detect and handle folder-specific search syntax
- Updated the search function to parse queries with `/` and filter by folder and alias accordingly
- Improved the sorting algorithm to prioritize exact folder matches
- Updated both the SearchPopup component and the search overlay to support folder searches

## Files Modified:

1. **`src/components/SearchPopup/SearchPopup.jsx`**
   - Added global keyboard event listener for better arrow key navigation
   - Enhanced focus management

2. **`src/hooks/useDebouncedSearch.js`**
   - Enhanced search function to handle folder-specific searches (e.g., "work/", "work/meet")
   - Improved sorting algorithm for folder searches
   - Added proper scoring for exact folder matches

3. **`src/search-overlay/search-overlay.js`**
   - Updated search functionality to support folder-specific searches
   - Enhanced sorting for folder searches
   - Improved query parsing for folder/alias combinations

## How It Works Now:

### Arrow Key Navigation:
- ↑/↓ arrow keys now work properly in the Cmd + Shift + O popup
- Navigation wraps around (goes to first item when at end, last item when at beginning)
- Proper focus management ensures keyboard events are captured

### Folder Search:
- Type `work/` to see all shortcuts in the "work" folder
- Type `work/meet` to find shortcuts in the "work" folder that contain "meet" in the alias
- Regular search still works for finding shortcuts across all folders
- Results are properly sorted with exact folder matches prioritized

The build completed successfully with no errors, and all functionality should now work as expected.
